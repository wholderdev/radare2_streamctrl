# Radare2 stdin/stdout redirect

Something I was working on to manage the stdin/stdout of the debugged program.

The idea is that instead of altering or tampering with the assembly, I can analyse a binary and alter the input in response to asm/output of the binary.

Might be useful for buffer overflow tests.
